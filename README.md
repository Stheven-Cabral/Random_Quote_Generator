# Random_Quote_Generator
 First Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project

The Random Quote Generator displays a quote from an array of movie quote objects. The movie quote objects contain mainly 4 properties: quote, source, citation, year, and tag (for a couple objects). I used vanilla JavaScript to build various functions that call a random quote object, displays the object properties in the quote box, changes the background color, and displays a different quote at a set interval.
